# Alternatives to Meetup.com
- Updated 15 October 2019

Given the recent [payment changes that Meetup.com is apparently ~~rolling out~~ testing](https://www.meetup.com/lp/paymentchanges) (they updated their page) that would result in people being charged $2 to RSVP to an event, people are looking for alternatives. These are some of the ones I have found. Note that Meetup serves multiple purposes:

- **Event discovery** - finding events near you or with your interests.
- **Event organization** - creating events as an organizer, listing them, publicizing them.
- **Event publicity** - providing easy ways to publicize and share your event.
- **Event attendance** - allowing people to RSVP to an event, providing a way to update attendees
- **Event comments** - organizers and attendees can leave comments on event pages with updates, messages, links, etc.
- **Event fees** - Meetup allows organizers to charge a fee to attendees to attend an event
- **Community building** - people can join a "meetup" and become part of that community, receiving updates about new events, commenting on events, etc.

It is not clear yet that there is any one alternative service that provides *all* of these functions. Many provide some features, but not all.

[*NOTE: I have NOT yet tested any of these myself. They are listed alphabetically in each section. In some cases I have added a few notes.*]

## Continuing to use Meetup without the payment changes

- If you are a Pro user or a nonprofit, you can continue to use the site without these fees.
